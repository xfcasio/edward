<h1 align='center'> Linux Eden Bot </h1>

<p align="center">
    <h3 align="center"> The Discord bot I wrote to manage the Linux Eden Discord server. </h3>

<h2> How can I use it for my server? </h2>
<p>
    In the beginning of `main.rs` there's a channel id array `SHOWCASE_CHANNELS` for the channels the bot's supposed to keep track of.
replace the ids with the ids of your server's showcase channels. <br>
    And on line 46 replace the channel id of your server's memes channel. Or remove the else-if block if you have none.
